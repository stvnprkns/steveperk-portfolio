        <p>Throughout this project, I interviewed <strong>over 100 small business owners, entrepreneurs, makers, and chefs</strong>. As a result, I learned that a majority of businesses did have CPAs and bookkeepers, many they knew through family or friends.<br></p>

        <h2>Online Matchmaking</h2>
        <p>One of the key insights I gathered from interviews was there was no such thing as a one-size-fits-all CPA. Our users wanted specialists who understood their industry as they did.¬†<br>‚Äç<br>To make these users feel comfortable, we started the CPA selection process with a series of filters. After the user imputed what was important to them, we presented¬† them with a list of CPAs the application had &quot;hand-selected.&quot;<br></p>

        <h2>Starting the Engagement</h2>
        <p>Once a customer was connected with an accountant they went through the &#x27;Consultation&#x27; tool. Since this was a lean experiment, we looked for the fastest, highest-value way to implement this feature. We chose to integrate it as a widget in Quickbooks since most small business owners already relied on the program to do their bookkeeping.<br></p>
