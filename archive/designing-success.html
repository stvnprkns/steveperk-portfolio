I found joy in helping others excel and creating opportunities for their success. When I joined RudderStack, I saw the chance to build a culture of design and an exceptional team of designers.<br>‚Äç<span class="ptitle"><br><br>ü§ù Establishing design</span><br>‚Äç<br>When I came to RudderStack, I noticed that design didn&#x27;t have a strong influence on the company. As a company founded by developers for developers, I saw an opportunity to enhance the user experience through great design and aimed to set a standard that would make RudderStack stand out.<br>‚Äç<span class="ptitle"><br><br>üßø An innovative team structure</span><br>‚Äç<br>My vision for the ideal creative team was different from my past experiences. Instead of assigning designers to specific areas or pillars, I aimed for a diverse skill set and a collaborative culture, inspired by the agency model. The core team included experienced creatives such as UI systems designers, Information Architects, UX Writers, and Design Researchers, fostering a collaborative environment.<br>‚Äç<br></p>

        <p>‚Äç<span class="ptitle">üïπ Resources and management</span><br>‚Äç<br>Collaboration is at the heart of design at RudderStack. I firmly believe in leveraging the diverse skill sets of our creatives to achieve outstanding results. When deciding which projects get a design lead, we consider factors like scope, complexity, and strategic importance. <br><br>My goal is for every project to benefit from the collective expertise of our visual designers, UX writers, researchers, and information architects. Ownership is assigned to areas that have the greatest impact and need the most attention. Fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing ensures that every voice is heard, leveraging our collective knowledge and skills for exceptional design outcomes.<br>‚Äç<br>‚Äç<br><span class="ptitle">üèÜ Design outcomes</span><br>‚Äç<br>Transitioning from 0 designers to 5 designers naturally leads to improved design results. We set measurable success goals for ourselves, aiming for both high velocity and high design quality. Our team improved the speed of our iteration cycles and introduced regular <strong>SUS (System Usability Score)</strong> surveys, a standard design measurement of customer satisfaction. These scores increased from <strong>64 to 68</strong> over the course of the first three quarters we measured SUS.</p>

            <p>At RudderStack, our engineering team is based in India, posing a unique challenge due to the 12.5-hour time difference. To address this, we&#x27;ve developed a hybrid approach that combines the best of waterfall and agile methodologies.<br><br>Our design process follows a broad structure: Planning, Kickoff, Research and Design, Engineering, and QA. But here&#x27;s the exciting part: within each phase, we sprinkle in agile sprints to execute our grand plan, adding spontaneity to keep things exciting!<br><br>During <strong>the Research phase</strong>, the design team comes together to plan and conduct interviews and data analysis to understand our customers&#x27; needs, behaviors, and quirks, enabling us to tackle the problem head-on.<br><br>Next, in the <strong>concepting phas</strong>e, UX Writing and Information Architecture collaborate to craft a compelling narrative and organize information intuitively.<br><br>Finally, our talented UI designer brings the vision to life using our design library, Anchor, for finishing touches.<br><br>But the secret sauce is collaboration. While we have our own areas of expertise, we constantly bounce ideas off each other and work as a tight-knit team. Our IA excels in both wires and writing, our UI designer can handle IA work, and our writer spots UI inconsistencies, enhancing our skills across disciplines.</p>

          <p>As our team has grown, my goal is to operationalize and showcase the value of our work through data and evidence. I aim to explore new opportunities for incorporating conceptual design and research based on behavioral anomalies. I&#x27;m eager to delve into motion design to create impactful brand experiences. With this amazing team, we&#x27;re ready to tackle any challenge. Let&#x27;s make it happen!</p>
