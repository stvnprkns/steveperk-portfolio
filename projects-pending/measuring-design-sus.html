        <p><span class="ideabrieftext blue">My Approach</span><span class="ptitle"><br><br>ü¶Ñ How to measure design?<br>‚Äç<br></span>Design, while in many cases seems to be this elusive, subjective experience. There are so many instances where something just &#x27;feels right.&#x27; But as design leaders, we really want to find ways to measure the effectiveness of design through quantitative or qualitative means. When it comes to features we can always look at scoring user journeys, the number of conversions, or the output of something, but when it comes to design as a whole within the product how do we know if it&#x27;s really getting better or we&#x27;re just doing a lot of work that &#x27;feels good?&#x27;<br>‚Äç<span class="ptitle"><br><br>ü§ù NPS is not for design</span><br>‚Äç<br>NPS is a very executive number. There have been countless articles about the faults with NPS, yet we still continue to do it and taut the number going up. NPS has some overlap with design and is really intended to get a broad strokes measure of how the company as a whole is improving. But design is only a segment of this and there is not often a direct measure for design. So we wanted to find something to really focus exclusively on the product experience.<br>‚Äç<span class="ptitle"><br><br>üßø System Usability Scale</span><br>‚Äç<br>Years ago I read an article from Gitlab, at the time it went over my head. Recently, looking to measure the effectiveness of design I rediscovered this article and dug in. So System Usability Scale was created in 1986 (<span class="mono"><em>IDK¬†why it took me so long to discover this, or why none of the companies I worked at prior did this</em></span>) and essentially measures the customer&#x27;s qualitative perspective of how usable, and intuitive the product is through 10 questions that alternate between positive and negative sentiment.<br>‚Äç<br></p>

        <p>‚Äç<span class="ptitle">üïπ Resources and management</span><br>‚Äç<br>Collaboration is at the heart of design at RudderStack. I firmly believe in leveraging the diverse skill sets of our creatives to achieve outstanding results. When deciding which projects get a design lead, we consider factors like scope, complexity, and strategic importance. <br><br>My goal is for every project to benefit from the collective expertise of our visual designers, UX writers, researchers, and information architects. Ownership is assigned to areas that have the greatest impact and need the most attention. Fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing ensures that every voice is heard, leveraging our collective knowledge and skills for exceptional design outcomes.<br>‚Äç<br>‚Äç<br><span class="ptitle">üèÜ Design outcomes</span><br>‚Äç<br>Transitioning from 0 designers to 5 designers naturally leads to improved design results. We set measurable success goals for ourselves, aiming for both high velocity and high design quality. Our team improved the speed of our iteration cycles and introduced regular <strong>SUS (System Usability Score)</strong> surveys, a standard design measurement of customer satisfaction. These scores increased from <strong>68 to 72</strong> over the course of the first three quarters we measured SUS.</p>

            <p>At RudderStack, our engineering team is based in India, posing a unique challenge due to the 12.5-hour time difference. To address this, we&#x27;ve developed a hybrid approach that combines the best of waterfall and agile methodologies.<br><br>Our design process follows a broad structure: Planning, Kickoff, Research and Design, Engineering, and QA. But here&#x27;s the exciting part: within each phase, we sprinkle in agile sprints to execute our grand plan, adding spontaneity to keep things exciting!<br><br>During <strong>the Research phase</strong>, the design team comes together to plan and conduct interviews and data analysis to understand our customers&#x27; needs, behaviors, and quirks, enabling us to tackle the problem head-on.<br><br>Next, in the <strong>concepting phas</strong>e, UX Writing and Information Architecture collaborate to craft a compelling narrative and organize information intuitively.<br><br>Finally, our talented UI designer brings the vision to life using our design library, Anchor, for finishing touches.<br><br>But the secret sauce is collaboration. While we have our own areas of expertise, we constantly bounce ideas off each other and work as a tight-knit team. Our IA excels in both wires and writing, our UI designer can handle IA work, and our writer spots UI inconsistencies, enhancing our skills across disciplines.</p>

          <p>As our team has grown, my goal is to operationalize and showcase the value of our work through data and evidence. I aim to explore new opportunities for incorporating conceptual design and research based on behavioral anomalies. I&#x27;m eager to delve into motion design to create impactful brand experiences. With this amazing team, we&#x27;re ready to tackle any challenge. Let&#x27;s make it happen!</p>
